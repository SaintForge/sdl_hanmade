---General---
+	1. Change order of the figure when it sticks to the grid 

+	2. Change the way in which we decide to pick a particular figure so that it
		checks the shell rectangles not just the whole area of the figure

+	3. Maybe we should change our list container just to array 
	 +	3.1 Get order of figure to work!!!

+	4. Highlight the default figure area whenever the grabbed figure is inside it
		or outside the screen
	 +	4.1 Make figure animation when it sticks to the default area

+	5. Implement moving blocks on the grid
 	+	5.1 Create horizontal block
	 +	5.2 Create vertical block
	 +	5.3 Make it move

+	6. Implement fancy appearance animation
	 +	6.1 grid appearance
	 +    6.2 moving blocks appearance
	 +	6.3 figure appearance

+	7. Fix boundaries check when figure gets outside the screen!
+	8. Find or implement a math vector!
-    9. Change unit field memory allocation to be just one block of memory instead 
		allocating memory for every row!
-	10. Need to think about the default size of active block size


---Data serialization---
+	1. Distinct assets into groups of sprites, sound and music
+	2. Make small level editor
+		2.1 Implement grid editor
+   	 2.2 Implement figure editor
+	3. Implement level data load/save from file

---Main Menu---
+	1. Implement level navigation
+	2. Implement level creation/deletion from level navigator
-	3. Implement main menu

---Misc---
+	1. Think about a better way to handle input events


BUGS:
	+ 1. When I want to pick the figure that lies on top of the figure that is sticked
	somehow I pick the one that is sticked instead of one that is on top of that
	- 2. There is something wrong with timer after loading another level
	+ 3. Pressing multiple keys on keyboard gives the weird result
	- 4. When pulling off the figure on the grid sometimes the wrong cell of the grid
		 gets disappeared
