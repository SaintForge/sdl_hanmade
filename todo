New TODO:
1. Deal with file mapping: 
	1. Divide file memory into 3 files: assets file, levels file, settings file
		- The binary file with assets and levels is crucial. Meaning if it doesn't exit - the game won't run.
		- Settings file is not important. If you don't have one of those - the game will run with default options
		- Should save file be pulled into memory (memory file mapping)?
		- Make some sort of hash table for assets?

	2. Shrink level amount to some decent number
	3. Animation everywhere
	4. Static linking with SDL
	5. Fix the editor bug and move the windows to some appropriate positions (Done. )
	6. Move timer and indicator to the playground code (Done.)
	7. Highlight or mark next available level in level menu. (Done. )
	8. Write code that checks if certain "color" series is completed and when it is then unlock first level of the same "color" level but in the next difficulty layer.
	9. Here's the idea for the menu background. Why don't we try to move around some generated background.

BUGS:
	1. When you make less figures in the editor and finish the level, the playground does not switch to the next level (Fixed.)
	2. Theres is some weird bug that is hard to reproduce. Sometimes whenever you delete or add figure, two figures pop up instead of one.


---General---
+	1. Change order of the figure when it sticks to the grid 

+	2. Change the way in which we decide to pick a particular figure so that it
		checks the shell rectangles not just the whole area of the figure

+	3. Maybe we should change our list container just to array 
	 +	3.1 Get order of figure to work!!!

+	4. Highlight the default figure area whenever the grabbed figure is inside it
		or outside the screen
	 +	4.1 Make figure animation when it sticks to the default area

+	5. Implement moving blocks on the grid
 	+	5.1 Create horizontal block
	 +	5.2 Create vertical block
	 +	5.3 Make it move

+	6. Implement fancy appearance animation
	 +	6.1 grid appearance
	 +    6.2 moving blocks appearance
	 +	6.3 figure appearance

+	7. Fix boundaries check when figure gets outside the screen!
+	8. Find or implement a math vector!
+    9. Change unit field memory allocation to be just one block of memory instead 
		allocating memory for every row!
+	10. Need to think about the maximum size of active block
+	11. Make game to be more resolution independent
-	12. Make shadows as a separate sprite for every figure???

---Data serialization---
+	1. Distinct assets into groups of sprites, sound and music
+	2. Make small level editor
+		2.1 Implement grid editor
+   	 2.2 Implement figure editor
+	3. Implement level data load/save from file

---Main Menu---
+	1. Implement level navigation
+	2. Implement level creation/deletion from level navigator
-	3. Implement main menu
-	4. Show some inditificator whether level is completed or not
-	5. Make difficulty levels 
-	6. Add block/unblock level button in editor gui

---Misc---
+	1. Think about a better way to handle input events

---Editor---
+	1. Change the size of the editor menu
+	2. Move level information near the editor
-	3. Add more information about the level
-	4. Set hotkeys for accessing the editor
-	5. Separate editor code from the game code so that no editor code will be in release
-	6. Make separate binary file for editor assets loading
+	7. Implement sorting selected buttons
+	8. Panel for resolution independence testing:

	   Object Scaler
	 <	 Width	>

       Target resolution
	Width: 1366 Height 768
	  Reference resolution
	Width: 800  Height 600
			Apply!

BUGS:
	+ 1. When I want to pick the figure that lies on top of the figure that is sticked
	somehow I pick the one that is sticked instead of one that is on top of that
	+ 2. There is something wrong with timer after loading another level
	+ 3. Pressing multiple keys on keyboard gives the weird result
	+ 4. When pulling off the figure on the grid sometimes the wrong cell of the grid
		 gets disappeared
	+ 5. Sometimes the game crushes whenever I press ~ on loading the level.
	+ 6. Level button switch behaviour is wrong when pressing mouse on it.
	- 7. There is some problem with grid animation when amount of row is less than amoun of columns.
	- 8. Finish animation starts with little wrong positioning of the blocks
	- 9. Editor problem. Whenever u delete a row or column and there was a moving block on that then something bad happens.p
